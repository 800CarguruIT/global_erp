# Vendor Portal Onboarding

Vendors access pricing, quotes, and procurement tools through the portal. To invite a vendor:

1. Add their company profile in **Vendors**.
2. Assign them the `vendor_user` role so procurement modules appear.
3. Provide the registration email and mobile phone to link to their portal account.
4. Confirm the quote flows once they accept the invite link.

Onboarding success also triggers notifications for admins in the `vendor` scope.
