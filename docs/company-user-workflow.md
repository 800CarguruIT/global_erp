# Company User Workflow

Company administrators can invite staff via the Company Users page. When they do:

1. Select the company and branch scope (optional) so that the account inherits the proper permissions.
2. Assign one or more company-scoped roles; assign `branches.view` before enabling `workshop` jobs so dashboards render.
3. Link HR employees via the `Employee Link` field to keep reporting aligned.
4. Invite the user — the system sends an email with a temporary password.

The status filter on the global user list allows you to move between active, inactive, and pending accounts.
