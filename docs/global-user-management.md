# Global User Management

This chapter documents the lifecycle of global administrators. Use the **Global Users** screen to invite, edit, and deactivate top-level accounts.

1. **Create** a user by providing a unique email and assigning the `global_admin` role.
2. **Assign roles** using the Roles & Permissions dashboard; this determines whether nested company/branch scopes are accessible.
3. **Monitor** activity with the “Last login” column and the Audit logs under Security Monitoring.
4. **Rotate passwords** via the reset modal: a fresh password is generated and saved immediately.

Keep the `mobile` field populated for help desk tasks and API access.
