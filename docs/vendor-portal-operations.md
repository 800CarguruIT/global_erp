# Vendor Portal Operations

Vendors collaborate on parts and service quotes inside the portal. Highlight the following workflows:

* **Quotes dashboard** – review pending, approved, and rejected quotes with the latest comments.
* **Procurement approvals** – once a quote is accepted, the procurement team receives a webhook event for fulfillment.
* **Support** – route issues via the vendor portal chat and escalate to the ops team when SLA thresholds are near.

Document each integration with the partner’s technical contact for easier troubleshooting.
