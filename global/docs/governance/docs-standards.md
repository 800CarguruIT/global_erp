# Documentation Standards

## Ownership

- Every doc must declare an owner.
- Owners are responsible for quarterly review.

## Freshness

- Include `Last Updated` in each file.
- Update docs in the same PR as behavioral code changes.

## Quality Gates

- Docs PR checklist should include:
  - Scope updated
  - API examples updated
  - Screenshots/diagrams refreshed (if affected)
  - Links validated

## Writing Conventions

- Prefer concrete examples.
- Keep module and endpoint names consistent with code.
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "soon" or "later"; use dates or versions.
